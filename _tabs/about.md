## Brief introduction
{:.mt-4 .mb-0 }

Greetings! I am Datcu Andrei, born on the 3rd of May, 2002, and I proudly serve as a DevOps Engineer. I consider myself a UNIX enthusiast, dedicating a significant portion of my time to researching and engaging in UNIX and UNIX-like tasks, which are integral to my professional endeavors. My journey with Linux began serendipitously around 2012 when I sought a lightweight alternative to Windows for my grandfather's laptop. This exploration marked the beginning of my enduring fascination with Linux, a fascination that has led me through an array of distributionsâ€”from Debian-based and Arch Linux-based systems to the intricate process of compiling and installing Gentoo on my primary machine.<br>

Today, my focus is on crafting the most stable, secure and efficient UNIX or UNIX-like experience possible. My passion for technology, coupled with commitment to excellence drives me to continuously explore innovative solutions, enhancing the capabilities and ensuring that the infrastructure of the team I work in remains at the forefront of technological advancements.<br>
